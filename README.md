# Betaflight-with-GPS-rescue-function-specially-for-F3-flight-control-custom-release
As a result of betaflight3.4 fly control firmware, resulting in F3 chip flight control, can not use GPS rescue mode, I deliberately in the open source to streamline the function, let F3 flight control also support GPS return function, modify the file please see my modified part!
