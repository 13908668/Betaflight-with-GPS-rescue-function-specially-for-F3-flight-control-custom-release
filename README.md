# Betaflight-with-GPS-rescue-function-specially-for-F3-flight-control-custom-release
In betaflight3.4 fly control firmware, resulting in F3 chip space is not enough, can not use GPS rescue mode, I open source to streamline certain functions, let F3 flight control also support GPS return function, profile please see my modified part! All rights Betaflight Original author, I just reinterpretation, let F3 also bring GPS rescue function.
